                <h3>ErgoSphere was created in the image of <a href="https://getumbrel.com" target="_blank">Umbrel</a>, which allows the easy setup of self-hosted Ergo services.</h3>

                <h1>Services</h1>
                <h3>An Ergo full node gets installed by default, which serves as the foundation for other services. <br><br>
                    Currently the following services are available on ErgoSphere:</h3> 
                <ul>
                    <li>Ergo explorer</li>
                    <li>ErgoMixer</li>
                    <li>ErgoDex offchain<br>execution</li>
                </ul> 
                <h3>This list is to be expanded with more services in the future.</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="descelements">
                <h1>Dependencies</h1>
                <h3>ErgoSphere is written in Java, and therefore can run on any system with a Java environment, however there are some additional dependencies:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>[Java >= 1.8]</li>
                    <li>Docker</li>
                    <li>Docker-compose (comes with Docker on Windows)</li>
                    <li>SBT</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="descelements">
                <h1>Running</h1>
                <h3>ErgoSphere must be ran with administrative privilages. This is to make sure there won't be permission problems when interacting with Docker or PowerShell. <br>
                    By default the web interface will be available on the local IP address of the host (e.g: 192.168.50.111), and all data will be stored in the "data" folder. <br>
                    NOTE: all other services will be available on this address on their respective ports <br>
                    Check README for command line parameters.</h3>
